						<h2>Fairy Castle, Dublin (Easy)</h2>

						<h2>Scarr Mountain, Wicklow (Moderate)</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>
							Following part of the Wicklow Way along a narrow lane, the route soon begins the ascent of the handsomely shaped Scarr mountain. After following the one kilometre summit ridge, it follows a rough mountain path to the subsidiary top of Kanturk. As we descend back into the valley there are great views of Knocknacloghoge and Lough Dan, where scenes from the TV series, ‘The Vikings’ were shot.

						<h2>Glendalough, Wicklow (Moderate)</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>
							Starting at the Glendalough visitor centre, this hike climbs onto the Derrybawn ridge for magnificent views of the surrounding mountains, it then follows a broad ridge over Mullacor, before turning onto a boardwalk across the Spinc, a long ridge with steep crags dropping to the lake below. A final descent via the Poulanass waterfall brings us back into the valley.

					<h2>Lugnaquilla, Wicklow (Hard)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>
						We climb Lugnaquilla via Fraughan Rock Glen, which offers a more gradual and scenic route to the summit, at 925 metres. This is the highest point in Leinster and one of only 13 mountains over 3000ft in Ireland. In good weather there are superb views across the Wicklow mountains, and beyond to the coast, even as far as Wales! One of our most popular itineraries.

						This tough hike packs a lot of interest into one day. Climb the iconic Djouce mountain, see the highest waterfall in Ireland, follow part of the Wicklow Way, take lunch under the Coffin Stone, and walk on the best example of an actively growing blanket bog, with its unique flora, to be seen in the east of Ireland.
